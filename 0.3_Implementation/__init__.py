MOTHERCORE - Enhanced Implementation

A field-governed collapse-based execution system implementing
the complete Intent Tensor Theory mathematical framework.

Components:
- Collapse Kernel: Core recursion engine with energy tracking
- Glyph Engine: 15 anchor glyphs + 6 PICS meta-glyphs
- Memory System: Curl memory with topology and non-local correlation
- IO Interface: Input/output vectorization
- Self-Modification: Adaptive learning and existence anchoring
