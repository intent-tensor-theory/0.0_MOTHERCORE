### Abstract
```
We present MOTHERCORE, a novel computational framework that models code execution as the collapse of intent fields in a pre-spatial recursive substrate. Drawing from field theory, differential geometry, and collapse interpretations of quantum mechanics, we introduce a mathematical formalism where computation emerges from the resolution of tension states through glyph-based geometric constraints.

Our framework implements four previously overlooked components we term the "Four Silent Elephants": the Recursive Identity Kernel, Global Topology Effects, Recursive Metric Drift, and Recursive Energy Definition. We provide a complete implementation demonstrating self-modification, topologically stable memory (habits), and emergent temporal direction from metric evolution.

The system achieves convergence in finite steps while exhibiting learned behaviors that persist across collapse cycles. This work bridges symbolic computation with continuous field dynamics, offering a unified mathematical foundation for adaptive, self-modifying systems.
